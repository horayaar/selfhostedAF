# selfhostedAF
A secure, self-hosted media server using Jellyfin, Docker, and Cloudflare Tunnel because why pay Google when you can suffer yourself?

## What is this?

**I turned an old, dusty PC into a fully-loaded, ad-free, self-hosted media beast.**

**selfhostedAF** is a DIY project that says:
- No to cloud subscription hell
- No to YouTube ads every 3.5 seconds
- No to port forwarding because my ISP is **SHIT**
- Yes to privacy and glory lol.

---

## What it does

- Runs a **Jellyfin media server** so I can stream my **totally-legally-acquired** content
- Lets me access everything with a **custom domain** like `media.suwaas.xyz`
- Shares files across LAN with **Samba(SMB)**
- Tunnels all that sweet traffic securely through **Cloudflare Tunnel** ‚Äî no ports harmed
- Runs everything in **Docker** because‚Ä¶ of course it does

## Deployment (for People Who Don't Read Blogs)

If you‚Äôre too cool to click blog links and too smart to follow tutorials (-_-), here‚Äôs the 10-second rundown:

```bash
# 1. Get Ubuntu server
# 2. Set static IP via Netplan
# 3. Install Samba, Jellyfin
# 4. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel using Docker
# 5. Point your domain at your LAN IP
# 6. Brag on LinkedIn
```
## But again, just read the damn blog ‚Äî it has pictures.
